    "This was my first time using both Rover and a pet/house sitter, so I was a bit nervous about leaving my three dogs while away on holiday. Catherine was patient with all my questions and put me at ease with the whole process. Knowing I was nervous, Catherine sent several pics and messages during the trip, which were all much appreciated. I returned to happy, well cared for dogs who did not have the stress of going to a kennel. It is comforting to know that if I need to go away again, Catherine is an excellent option for the dogs who probably are hoping that is not too far off."
