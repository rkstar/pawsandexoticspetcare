    "Catherine was wonderful taking care of our beloved dog Punkin. She was reliable and trustworthy and showed how much she loved animals the minute she walked in our door! She made herself available anytime we needed her. To be away from our family pet was very difficult but knowing Catherine was taking care of her gave us peace of mind! We have a new dog now and we absolutely will call on Catherine for her pet minding services because we know our Timber will be happy and very well cared for at all times! I highly recommend Catherine to anyone looking for quality pet care!!"
