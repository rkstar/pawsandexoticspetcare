    "First time leaving our dogs (senior boxer and busy lab pup) with anyone aside from family. Met Catherine and the dogs immediately liked her. She listed to all instructions and agreed to sit on the day needed. We also liked Catherine and could tell she was a dog person. The day arrived that she was going to sit and upon her arrival, I was reviewing instructions previously given. Catherine was able to repeat back all information given the week previous almost word for word. She knew exactly what time to feed, where they could go and not go and little things to watch out for. We were able to enjoy a family wedding and not worry about the dogs. It was such a relief! We intend to use Catherine again. She was prompt, knowledgeable and did a great job. Logan & Morgan's mom."
