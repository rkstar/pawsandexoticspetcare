    "Highly recommended pet care services. Catherine and her team member Nilay were tasked with looking after our Jack Russell (Jerry) overnight in our home. Jerry is a high energy dog and has anxiety and Catherine was very patient with him and provided us with updates throughout the evening. They were very accommodating as we had to return home unexpectedly in the middle of the night. Would definitely use Paws and Exotics Pet Care services again and recommend to friends and family looking for peace of mind while having to leave their pet at home."
