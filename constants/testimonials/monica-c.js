    "Catherine looked after my bunny during this past Christmas break and she did a stellar job! Not only did she follow a plethora of instructions perfectly, but she also updated me daily with pictures and clearly enjoyed playing with my rabbit while she was doing her daily visits. As I normally let my bunny out to free roam when Iâ€™m home, it was a great relief to know that she had some time to stretch her little legs and play while I was away on vacation with a great sitter! I would definitely recommend her to anybody looking for an exotics pet sitter, she was excellent!"
