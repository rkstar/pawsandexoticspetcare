Sent update pictures and videos of\nthem playing and laying around. Came home to happy, healthy kitties!\n        </Testimonial>\n        <Testimonial by=\"Meredith M\">\n        This was my first time using both Rover and a pet/house sitter, so I was a bit\nnervous about leaving my three dogs while away on holiday. Catherine was patient\nwith all my questions and put me at ease with the whole process. Knowing I was\nnervous, Catherine sent several pics and messages during the trip, which were all\nmuch appreciated. I returned to happy, well cared for dogs who did not have the\nstress of going to a kennel. It is comforting to know that if I need to go away again,\nCatherine is an excellent option for the dogs who probably are hoping that is not too\nfar off.\n        </Testimonial>\n        <Testimonial by=\"Judy P\">\n        I have three pure bred cats, 2 are 2 years and one 4 months, they are my babies and I am glad to have found Catherine to look after them when I travel for business or pleasure!
