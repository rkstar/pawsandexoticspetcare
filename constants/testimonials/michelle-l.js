    "This was our first time using Rover and working with Catherine. We were nervous to leave our pets at first, but Catherine went above and beyond! From day one we were re-assured that our animals were in good hands with Catherine. She sent us pictures and updates daily, and kept our house in better shape than we left it. Our pets loved her, and we now worry they actually may be missing her! We will definitely be booking Catharine again for any and all future trips."
